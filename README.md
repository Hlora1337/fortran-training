# fortran-training
here I have tasks that I did fully for fun and matter of working as Fortran Developer

01.01.2026

added HelloWorld.f90 because I can, as a start of job

added Variables.f90 so I'll see what variables actually exist normally

added variable_task.f90. it has printing name and surname, circle square and Celsius to Fahrenheit converter. Simple tasks really
