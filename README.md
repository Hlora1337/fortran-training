# fortran-training
here I have tasks that I did fully for fun and matter of working as Fortran Developer

01.01.2026

added HelloWorld.f90 because I can, as a start of job

added Variables.f90 so I'll see what variables actually exist normally

added variable_task.f90. it has printing name and surname, circle square and Celsius to Fahrenheit converter. Simple tasks really

Wanted to make a program that writes data to txt and checks if it's existing there already or not. understood that I'm too dumb for that for now, left for later

02.01.2026

I added my SimpleCalc. If you want to see how it works, gfortran in your hands, write help in command line and follow instructions

I also added 3 things:
1. had fun with output formatting

2. VERY SIMPLE CALCULATOR

3. And converter from seconds to hours, minutes and seconds, yeah

03.01.2026

Technically, done 3rd of January, uploaded on 4th of January. There are two programs:

1. finds maximum number out of 3 integers

2. prints if year is leap or not

04.01.2026

made 2 small programs:

1. Grade Checker

2. Month Checker

Also did task from Exercism.io, yeah, but with small help of AI, so, doesn't count

11.01.2026

Had procrastination strike, so, now I'm returned

Completed exercises in Exercism (I'll make list of them one day)

And played with loops just a bit like a little kid.

14.01.2026

Played with loops a bit, pretty useless things like printing what you write until it's == 0, and until it's / 7 = 0 or / 13 == 0

Made guessing game, it's pretty fun for me, yeah ^_^

17.01.2026

At 15th of January wrote Euclidal algortithm, Fibonacci algorithm and reverse number converter in Fortran, practicing iterative way of writing.

Also just wrote Factorial program in 10 minutes, dunno if it's fast

19.01.2026

made really quick Multiplication table, learning array intrinsics, test programs will come later

21.01.2026

Made simple program that counts sum, mean, min/max and amount of positive and negative numbers from array. Compiled file in ArrayManipulations folder
