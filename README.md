# fortran-training
here I have tasks that I did fully for fun and matter of working as Fortran Developer

01.01.2026

added HelloWorld.f90 because I can, as a start of job

added Variables.f90 so I'll see what variables actually exist normally

added variable_task.f90. it has printing name and surname, circle square and Celsius to Fahrenheit converter. Simple tasks really

Wanted to make a program that writes data to txt and checks if it's existing there already or not. understood that I'm too dumb for that for now, left for later

02.01.2026

I added my SimpleCalc. If you want to see how it works, gfortran in your hands, write help in command line and follow instructions

I also added 3 things:
1. had fun with output formatting

2. VERY SIMPLE CALCULATOR

3. And converter from seconds to hours, minutes and seconds, yeah

03.01.2026

Technically, done 3rd of January, uploaded on 4th of January. There are two programs:

1. finds maximum number out of 3 integers

2. prints if year is leap or not
